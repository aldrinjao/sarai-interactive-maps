                  <p>
                    The Standardized Vegetation-Temperature Ratio (SVTR), a novel drought index for the Philippines, was developed by Drought and Crop Assessment and Forecasting (DCAF) Project, to detect and assess local agricultural drought (Perez et al., 2016).  This drought indicator follows the ratio of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which represents the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation, and LST (Land Surface Temperature), which enables assessment of how the seasonal and interannual changes in the vegetation are related to changes in surface temperature. Literature indicates that the relationship between NDVI and LST could be a proxy for soil moisture profile in a specific location (Sandholt et al., 2002); hence, it shows great potential in assessing agricultural drought conditions. In the following map, threshold values are set at severe, moderate, mild, and normal. SVTR values above -0.5 denote normal or non-drought conditions, while SVTR values below -0.5 signify agricultural areas experiencing water-related crop stresses.
